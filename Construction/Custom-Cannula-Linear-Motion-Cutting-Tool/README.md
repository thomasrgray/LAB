# Custom-Cannula-Linear-Motion-Cutting-Tool

A 3D-printed guide cannula implant, as well as a rotary-tool-based cutting station for the fabrication of cannulae.

Designed by Daniela Puzzo (daniela.puzzo@unict.it, danypuzzo@yahoo.it)

This project was designed to facilitate access to custom-made cannulae. This project has been validated through a novel-object-recognition test. Although originally designed for mice, the authors describe, step by step, how the implant can be replicated and modified to fit individual needs.
